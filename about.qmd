Hello, I'm Christof Henkel!

I'm a deep learning researcher at NVIDIA. I'm particularly interested in novel deep learning architectures with respect to graphs, computer vision and audio. I have a background in probability theory and specialized in stochastic processes about which I did a PhD at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Univerity in Munich. I started kaggling 5 years ago and after participating in more than 50 competitions currently hold the 1st rank in the worl-wide competition ranking.
